# Advent of Code 2025 — Solutions

This repository contains my Advent of Code 2025 puzzle solutions. Each day has
its own folder (Day-1, Day-2, ...), containing a short README, inputs and a
solution implementation.

Example - run Day-1 locally:
```bash
python3 Day-1/solution.py Day-1/input1.txt
```
Enjoy solving! 🎄
